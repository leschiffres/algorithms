# Dynamic Programming

## List of problems

- Longest Common Subsequence
	- Given two strings, find their longest common subsequence e.g. `"ijustwantsometea"`, `"teaiswhatyouneed"` `LCS = "iswatoee"`
- Longest String Chain
	- Given a list of strings, find the longest chain, where the chain has the property that you can go from the one word to the next one just by adding one letter. e.g. `["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]` the result is 4 (a -> ba -> bca -> bdca)
